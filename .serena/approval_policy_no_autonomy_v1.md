# Approval Policy (No Autonomy)

- Zero autonomy: never change logic or behavior without explicit boss approval.
- Approval marker: a visible “APPROVED: <content>” must exist in the current session.
- Ask first: any ambiguity must be clarified and approval obtained before starting.
- Pre‑change brief (even for numeric tweaks):
  - Equations / bases before vs after
  - Representative impact metrics (before/after)
  - Scope and risks (concise)
- Execution rules:
  - Change exactly one thing (no concurrent edits)
  - Apply the smallest possible diff
  - Report result and diff after execution
- Monitoring:
  - Do not disable logs/visual aids without approval; if disabled, record reason and approval link
- Safety:
  - Edit config/geometry via safe write (no fragile partial regex); validate immediately after save
  - If load/validation fails, do not silently fall back; stop and surface the error
- Audit:
  - Reject unapproved operations and emit an audit log
- Scope:
  - Do not record domain-specific numeric details in memory; retain only principles
